# Sparse Feature-Based Visual Odometry and SLAM
This code shown the use of Bundle Adjustment to construct the 3D map of the environment as well as calculate the camera poses from each frame.

Here I have developed the essential elements of a vehicle-based Visual SLAM system which is implemented in GTSAM. The vehicle drives in simulated city. A plan view of the city, together with the trajectory taken by the vehicle is shown below.
